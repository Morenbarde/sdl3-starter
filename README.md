# sdl3-starter
This repository defines a simple base for setting up an SDL3 project in a Linux environmet.


## Installation

To install, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Morenbarde/sdl3-starter.git
cd sdl3-starter
```

## Usage
This repository is designed to be built with a CMake environment. Modify [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) to change the project name or add any desired executables.

To generate makefiles, run:
```
cmake -B build
```

To build the project, run make in the build directory
```
cd build
make
```

To run the project, run the generated executable. By default, this will be the project name defined in the CMakeLists.txt file. As is, this will be:
```
./sdl3-starter
```

If any files are added to the source directory, cmake needs to be run again to detect them. This can be done from the build directory.
```
cmake ..
```
